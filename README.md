# Library - Management System
## Task Description

The task was to create a simple library management system writen in Object-oriented programming paradigm. It enables the management of books, users, borrowings, and the library's state.

## Project Structure

### The code encompasses the following elements:

1. Classes representing individual objects: User, Book, Booking, Library, LibraryBook.
2. Interfaces for each class, defining typing for all properties and methods.
3. Implementation of logic for adding, removing, and managing books, users, and borrowings.
4. Utilization of unique UUID identifiers for user and book identification.

## Biggest Challenge

The main challenge during the project development was managing the borrowing logic, book returns, and their availability in the library. Understanding the relationships between users, books, their quantity, and borrowing deadlines was crucial for the system's correct functioning.

## Throughout the project, I learned:

Effective management of relationships between classes and their interactions.
Implementation and management of interfaces for different classes.
Development of business logic for management systems.
